# Introduction 

The problem of car collisions has always been a persistent situation in traffic. But the causes of traffic accidents are always diverse. In order to help create a safe traffic system in the city, and also bring more convenient travel to the city residents, people should also pay attention to it, and the government should also take relevant measures to curb the occurrence of such things. Tempe hopes to reduce fatal and serious injuries to zero through efforts. But the prevention of accidents needs the joint efforts of the government and the people, and people also need to pay attention to the causes of accidents, so as to create an orderly urban traffic. So today, we focus on the data of vehicle to vehicle, vehicle to bicycle and vehicle to pedestrian collisions in Tempe City, and try to find out the way to prevent a large number of accidents.

It also leads to several noteworthy problems.

1. Does the road section with the most traffic accidents reduce the number of traffic accidents over time? It also reflects whether people pay more attention to the traffic accidents in the past and whether the government monitors the road section.

2. The objective factors causing the accident, such as drunk and drug driving, as well as the influence of ground moisture and weather. 

3. The specific cause of the accident, that is, the specific cause of the driver's error. 

4. It's not discrimination against age, to see if age is also the cause of car accidents. Because it is true that the growth of age will make people more or less lose part of their body performance, in order to ensure the safety of the elderly and other people, whether the government should arrange good protective measures.

# Question 1 

The data collection is to help the city reduce the occurrence of vehicle collisions. According to the extraction of vehicle collision data on the same road section, we can see whether people are more careful to reduce their own mistakes after a continuous and repeated traffic accident on a road section. In addition, whether the government finds that the frequent traffic accidents are caused by road design problems. According to the observation of the year of the car crash, we can find out whether this kind of problem has been solved. We first select the top ten road sections with the most vehicle collisions, because more data can better reflect the relatively accurate answers.

Through the linear chart, the results are clearly displayed. First of all, in the selected ten cross stress, the number of traffic accidents in six cross stress is on the rise. Although it will decrease slightly in the next few years, it still shows that the number of traffic accidents has not attracted people's attention or improved by the government because of a large number of traffic accidents. Although the number of traffic accidents on the other four road sections did not show an upward trend, they also maintained the same number or only decreased a few. However, it is worth noting that when we look at the number of traffic accidents in "southern ave" from 2012 to 2013 years, we can see that at least 40 accidents have been reduced, and the same situation also occurs in "rural Rd", "price RD" and other cross stress. Therefore, it can be concluded that the government may also increase the police force or repair the existing security risks on the road with high accident incidence, but such behavior only lasted for one year and will not be greatly improved.

# Question 2

The cause of the collision.

To explore the causes of vehicle collisions, it is easy to see the cases of traffic accidents caused by drunk driving and drug driving. What's more, we can also see the influence of fatigue driving and night lights on drivers by extracting the accident cases that happened in the early morning. Still can analyze external influences like the light condition, weather condition and also surface conditions.

First of all, we exclude the cases in which the injuries is 0 in the case of drunkenness and drug abuse, because the situation of casualties is usually more serious and noticeable. Only two of the cases of drunk drivers and drug addicts suffered heavy casualties, with nine injured respectively. And there are more than 30 cases in which more than three people were injured, so it is not difficult to guess that the case was caused by multiple vehicle collisions. Therefore, the driver's unconsciousness is likely to cause multiple vehicle accidents, and it is impossible to avoid the situation of collision with pedestrians.

It's easy to see that of all the traffic accidents in the data, only three accidents caused 9 injuries, two of which were caused by drunkenness and drug abuse. And also can see Degree of injury through the "Injuryseverity" column.

Also the early morning also affect the cause of accident, which is the time between 12AM and 6AM. First, there were 11921 accidents at early morning, accounting for 31% of the whole data. This is already a high proportion, because the early morning only accounts for a quarter of the total time. The second point is that it is very clear from the histogram that there are relatively more traffic accidents at 12Am. The reason may be that 12Am is still an off-duty time or someone is still out for nightlife.

Still choose to look at objective factors, such as weather, Light condition and Surface condition.

So far, it is clear that these factors have a certain impact on the occurrence of car accidents, but still most of the vehicles will have car accidents relatively without external influence.

Weather condition: without the case have unknown weather condition, there are 1221 case have weather effect which is 7.6%


Surface condition: without the case have unknown surface condition, there are 2889 case have surface effect which is 3.2%

Light condition: without the case have unknown light condition and weird content, there are 10253 case have light effect which is 27%


# Question 3

Subjective causes of vehicle collision

Vehicle collision is usually a conflict between two vehicles. By comparing the errors of two drivers and the environment at that time, we can better analyze the causes of specific accidents. But also the driver who mainly caused the accident will be put in the first place.

There are more drivers because the speed too fast cause accident which have 11918 cases and 31%. And also some because failed To Yield Right Of Way and Unsafe Lane Change. Some of these things can let the local government write slogans on the road, such as slowing down, etc. But most of them need people's self-awareness and attention. If the government wants to reduce the number of traffic accidents to the minimum, in addition to self-improvement, it also needs to make people pay more attention to driving safety.

# Question 4

The influence of age on vehicle collision.There is no discrimination against age, but there are many older drivers in the data. We can compare the age and the cause of the traffic accident to find out whether the age is related to the cause of the traffic accident.

First of all, I extracted the old people aged between 60 and 100, because there are also those who are very old in the data. I don't think this is realistic, so I didn't use it. There are 3440 drivers in this age group, and one fourth of them are failed to yield right of way. So I think that age is the influencing factor, because it is inevitable that sometimes the decline of behavior ability or the failure to quickly confirm the road situation will lead to the existence of safety hazards.


# Conclusion

In general, the results of data analysis are in our expectation. In recent years, the causes of traffic accidents caused by vehicle collision have been common, and they have always been the same reasons. But in order to avoid large-scale accidents and reduce casualties. People should start to pay attention to it. For example, according to the analysis of the data on the same road section, the causes of traffic accidents have been on the rise from 2012 to 2021, that is, the occurrence of a large number of accidents has not attracted people's attention. Similarly, the government can carry out more warning slogans or police blessing on the road section, and try to avoid the occurrence of this situation as far as possible. Secondly, drunkenness and a series of items that may cause unconsciousness are always prohibited when driving, but some people still choose to continue driving, but eventually a large number of casualties will be caused. For their own safety and the safety of others, please stop this happening again. And then because of the influence of the surface humidity, the brightness of the road and the special weather, the occurrence of traffic accidents also increased significantly. The third interesting discovery is that 31% of vehicle collisions are caused by too fast speed. This series of reasons can be controlled artificially, which also warns people to pay more attention to safety when driving. Finally, 10% of the drivers who cause traffic accidents are in the old age. This is not against the old people coming to the car. This is that if there is a traffic accident, the old people can suffer more serious injuries. But in order to ensure the health of the elderly, people can also choose to pay more attention to this aspect.

## Analysis document

# Abstract

Fatal and seriously injured crashes are not "accidents", they can be prevented. Tempe is committed to reducing fatal and serious injuries to zero.

Today, we pay attention to the data of accidents in Tempe City, including the data of vehicle to vehicle, vehicle to bicycle and vehicle to pedestrian collisions. The accidents have been updated in recent months, and the new data also help us to better operate and find new ideas. 

# Overview and Motivation

Vehicle accidents will lead to casualties and road congestion, but through people's attention and effective management of the government, this situation can be avoided in a small amount, and people's casualties can also be reduced.I hope that through the analysis of the data to find out the cause of the accident and cause people's attention.

# Related Work

What arouses my interest in recent years, no matter where the area is, the occurrence of traffic accidents is inevitable, especially a large number of people are injured. In order to protect the safety of others and myself, I hope to analysis related data to find new things and also to attract people's attention. 


# Initial Questions

1. The data collection is to help the city reduce the occurrence of vehicle collisions. According to the extraction of vehicle collision data on the same road section, we can see whether people are more careful to reduce their own mistakes after a continuous and repeated traffic accident on a road section. In addition, whether the government finds that the frequent traffic accidents are caused by road design problems. According to the observation of the year of the car crash,  we can find out whether this kind of problem has been solved. 

2. The cause of the collision which including drunk driving and drug driving and also the influence of fatigue driving and night lights on drivers by extracting the accident cases that happened in the early morning. Still can analyze external influences like the light condition, weather condition and also surface conditions.

3. Subjective causes of vehicle collision. Vehicle collision is usually a conflict between two vehicles. By comparing the errors of two drivers and the environment at that time, we can better analyze the causes of specific accidents. But also the driver who mainly caused the accident will be put in the first place. 
To explore the causes of each driver's car accident, we can also better see whether there are problems involved in the road section, such as blind areas at the intersection corners, which lead to the inability to see passing vehicles, and so on.

4. Of course, there are also some cases of vehicles hitting pedestrians, which will cause casualties. Therefore, if the government wants to reduce such cases, such cases need to be dealt with emphatically.
The influence of age on vehicle collision. First of all, there is no discrimination against age, but there are many older drivers in the data. We can compare the age and the cause of the traffic accident to find out whether the age is related to the cause of the traffic accident.

# Data: 

data sources: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/1-08-crash-data-report-detail

```


# Exploratory Data Analysis

Question 1

```{r}
cross_stress_crash<-crash_data_report%>%group_by(CrossStreet)%>%
  count(CrossStreet)%>%
  arrange(desc(n))%>%
  head(10)
cross_stress_crash
```
```{r}
#if the stress got many car crash, is that means the design many cause many accident. And during the years, did the government will found that and change something to make the less accident? did some people notice the news and become more careful?
cross_stress_year_crash<-crash_data_report%>%group_by(Year)%>%
  count(CrossStreet)%>%
  arrange(desc(n))%>%
  spread(Year,n)%>%
  filter(CrossStreet=="Rural Rd"|CrossStreet=="Southern Ave"|CrossStreet=="Broadway Rd"|CrossStreet=="Priest Dr"|CrossStreet=="McClintock Dr"|CrossStreet=="University Dr"|CrossStreet=="Price Rd"|CrossStreet=="Mill Ave"|CrossStreet=="Hardy Dr"|CrossStreet=="Rio Salado Pkwy")%>%gather("year","number of crash",2:9)
cross_stress_year_crash

cross_stress_year_crash%>%ggplot(aes(x=year,y=`number of crash`,group=CrossStreet,color=CrossStreet))+geom_line()

cross_stress_year_crash%>%ggplot(aes(x=year,y=`number of crash`,group=CrossStreet))+geom_line()+facet_wrap("CrossStreet")

```

First, we summarize and group by all the cross stress with vehicle collisions, and then arrange the number of traffic accidents in descending order, so as to find out the cross stress with high incidence of traffic accidents and also select the top ten road sections with the most accidents, no matter whether they cause casualties or not.

Second, we can visualize the data to make this point more effectively. Specify, we can analyze whether the number of traffic accidents is decreasing on the basis of the above and the specific year, so as to analyze whether the local government or people have made changes.Through the graphic, the result of the problem is very clear. We consider the number of accidents on the different cross stress in different years and also arrange them in same graphic. In order to make the graphic clearer, we divide it into ten different pictures to show ten different road sections.

In the project, this problem is the main research. It can give people more information, such as the high probability of the accident occurred in the section, which means that people should pay more attention and be more careful when passing through the section. And should the government put warning signs on the road to remind people? These are all ideas reflected in the project. Because the number of traffic accidents in most of the ten road sections is still on the rise, as time goes on.

In the project, I also considered that I should use cross stress, because the data will be more diversified and there are many avoidable causes of traffic accidents.Then new problems will arise, and the normal road section will make my data inaccurate, so I choose to study only one specific road section, such as cross stress.


Question 2

```{r}
#The impact of drug use and drunk driving
drunk_impact<-crash_data_report%>%filter(AlcoholUse_Drv1=="Alcohol")%>%#1628 alcohol
  select(JunctionRelation,Totalinjuries,Injuryseverity,Collisionmanner,AlcoholUse_Drv1)%>%
  arrange(desc(Totalinjuries))%>%
  filter(Totalinjuries>=1)
drunk_impact%>%ggplot(aes(x=Totalinjuries))+geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
drug_impact<-crash_data_report%>%filter(DrugUse_Drv1=="Drugs")%>%#285 drug
  select(JunctionRelation,Totalinjuries,Injuryseverity,Collisionmanner,DrugUse_Drv1)%>%
  arrange(desc(Totalinjuries))%>%
  filter(Totalinjuries>=1)
drug_impact%>%ggplot(aes(x=Totalinjuries))+geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
crash_data_report%>%filter(Totalinjuries>=9)
```

```{r}
drug_impact%>%count(Injuryseverity)
```

```{r}
#time -- The chance of a car accident in the early morning 
early_morning_crash<-crash_data_report%>%separate(DateTime,into=c("date","time"),sep=" ")%>%
  separate(time,into=c("hour","minute","second"),sep=":")%>%
  filter(hour>="00"&hour<="06")%>%
  arrange(hour)%>%#11921 night crash
  select(date,hour,Totalinjuries)%>%
  filter(Totalinjuries>=1)
early_morning_crash%>%ggplot()+geom_histogram(aes(x=Totalinjuries))+facet_wrap("hour")
```


```{r}
other_condition<-crash_data_report%>%select(Lightcondition,Weather,SurfaceCondition,Totalinjuries)

other_condition%>%count(Lightcondition)
other_condition%>%count(Weather)
other_condition%>%count(SurfaceCondition)
```

I filter the specific columns, like for drugs and drunk, just filter the rows with columns for Alcohol and the answer is yes. Same for others. And about the early morning, filter the time between 12AM and 6AM. This problem can be reflected by a simple table, just a simple extraction of the special conditions needed.

Question 3

```{r}
#specific reason for cause the violation 
crash_data_report%>%count(Violation1_Drv1)%>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

```{r}
#two driver 
two_driver<-crash_data_report%>%select(Violation1_Drv1,Unitaction_Two)
```

To explore the causes of each driver's car accident, we can also better see whether there are problems involved in the road section, such as blind areas at the intersection corners, which lead to the inability to see passing vehicles, and so on. First, we count the distinct violent occurs on the driver 1 which the driver causes the accident and the n mean the number of accident cause by in this reason. Then arrange them in descending order. second, we can also take a look about two drivers have the cause of the accident to help me check if I made a mistake. The method is to select the two columns which relate their reason to cause an accident. 

Question 4

```{r}
age_crash<-crash_data_report%>%select(Age_Drv1,Violation1_Drv1,Unitaction_One,Unittype_One)%>%
  filter(Age_Drv1>=60)%>%
  filter(Age_Drv1<100)%>%
  arrange(desc(Age_Drv1))

age_crash%>%count(Violation1_Drv1)%>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

First we can select the column we need which include the age and violation and then filter the age between 60 and 80 which is regarded as an elderly group. Then try to find out the cause of the accident and help to see the influence of age on the accident. (There is no discrimination against age, but in order to ensure the safety of the elderly, we should also pay attention to this kinds of accident)


# Final Analysis

I learned a lot from the data. First of all, driving should have a high degree of mental clarity. For example, drunkenness and drug abuse have a great impact on people's judgment of things, and it will also cause many people's injuries. Second, the accident probability of high accident section is still very high, which also needs people's self attention and government supervision. Third, external factors of weather or ground also lead to vehicle collision.
